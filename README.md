# Roberto Mayen-Hess | Full stack software engineer 
Software developer with previous experience in project management. Currently pursuing an MBA. 

## What I'm currently working on: 

YelpCamp is Colt Steele's 2021 Web Developer Bootcamp's massive final project. 
It's a complete CRUD app built with HTML, Boostrap on the front-end and NodeJS and Mongo on the back-end.

Features: 
- Multiple image upload
- User authentication
- User authorization

Doesn't sound like much, but it's an easy 100 hours in. I've learned a lot and enjoyed it immensely. Planning on using it as a template for my next app.

## What I'm working on next: 
### CRUD app: 
**Business problem**: 
Current sales process: sales lead -> contact -> appointment -> visit and assessment -> quote proposal is sent -> quote is approved/rejected -> 
  - if approved -> purchase order & production order
  - if rejected -> contact customer and try to negotiate/ get feedback

### Product objective: 
Simplify sales process

### Product description: 
The product will reduce the steps in the process by simplifying the sales process:
| Current process | Problem | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Sales lead | Sales lead requires several contacts with customer. Each step can cause the sales process to fail | Sales lead + contact + appointment => Customer can book appointment without interacting with the company (through web app) |
| Visit and assessment | Quote is sent after visit. Customer must then approve/reject/negotiate. Time consuming and sales process may fail at every step | Integrate the visit/assessment and quote proposal => The salesperson can provide the customer with all the information necessary to approve/reject the proposal on the spot |

### Project requirements: 
Frontend: 
  - Home
  - About
  - Products
  - Blog
  - Schedule an appointment
  - FAQ
  - Contact
Backend: 
- CRUD functionality
- MongoDB database
- Upload image functionality
- Oauth functionality
- Export?
