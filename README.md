# Full Stack Web 3 & Smart Contract Development

I am a law school graduate with a passion for entrepreneurship and innovation. Throughout my professional career, I have had the opportunity to co-design, co-create, and manage a successful startup incubator in Latin America, which has been thriving for over a decade. My experience extends beyond the legal field. I have also worked in the hospitality industry and progressed from a barista to an assistant manager. I helped train and transition between bar managers during one of the restaurant's busiest times. I further enhanced my skills by completing an online MBA specializing in venture capital and entrepreneurship.

After moving to the US, I became interested in blockchain technology and started learning to code smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. I have been self-taught and participated in a free online boot camp, where I learned the MERN stack and have been learning Haskell and Plutus to build on the Cardano blockchain. In addition, I have led an onboarding course in Spanish for new non-technical persons trying to get involved in the Cardano ecosystem. Finally, I am collaborating on several initiatives in the Cardano ecosystem, including Gimbalabs, the Cardano RealFi Consortium, and a blockchain capability consultancy called 45b.
